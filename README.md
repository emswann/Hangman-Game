# Hangman-Game

This application is an old-fashioned Hangman game powered by JavaScript to dynamically update HTML.

The user has 12 chances to guess a computer generated word. If you guess a letter in the word, you do not lose a guess. If you do not guess a letter in the word, the number of guesses decreases by one. Each wrong guess results in another piece of the hangman being drawn. The application keeps track of already guessed letters and does not allow guesses which are not letters of the alphabet. The application also keeps track of all games won and lost. 

Good=luck and don't get "hanged"!
